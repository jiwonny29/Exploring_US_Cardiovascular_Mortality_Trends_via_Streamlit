# Stat 663 Individual Project  

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Streamlit web application to provide users with insights into the mortality rates of cardiovascular (CVD) and heart disease across the United States. Globally and within the US, CVDs are recognized as leading causes of death, with one person succumbing to them every 33 seconds in the US alone. The application seeks to empower viewers and users to easily comprehend how mortality rates per 100,000 population have evolved over time from 2000 to 2020 in each state.

By selecting filters for year, state, and one of the eight different cardiovascular diseases, users can access specific and detailed mortality rate information for their chosen criteria, along with the population and life expectancy at birth for the selected year. At the bottom of the page, a US map will illustrate the comparison between states regarding the top-ranked cardiovascular disease, providing users with valuable insights into the geographical distribution of major cardiovascular diseases across the nation.
